// // Requirements

// (1) Mutual exclusion
// Never have more than one process in the critical section at once. 

// We'll use the inductive technique to check this. We had an interesting
// discussion about whether certain operators were needed in this context. 
//  I've taken some notes on that discussion.

    // ENRICHMENT: FORBID PRESTATES WITH BAD POLITENESS

    // Needs excluding, but too weak...
    (some p: Process | World.loc[p] in (InCS + Waiting)) implies
       some World.polite

    // Stronger:
    // (World.polite != p1)
    all disj p1,p2: Process | World.loc[p1] = InCS => { 
        World.polite = p2

-- If the initial state is really initial, then it's good. 
req_me_init: assert init is sufficient for good_me
-- Why don't we need `always` here? Because we're using the inductive approach. 
--   Temporal Forge will indeed always give us a full trace, but we have not said 
--   it must be a _valid trace of this system_. Thus, we can ignore everything but 
--   the first state. If we started to do something more complex, we'd want to 
--   think carefully about whether `always` is needed. 

pred next_good_me {
    -- next_state: advance the state index by one
    next_state good_me}

//req_me_consec: assert  
//  {good_me and delta} is sufficient for next_good_me
-- Why no `always` here? Again, because we're using the inductive method, 
-- we only care about the first two states of the trace Forge finds us. 
-- the "trace that Forge finds" isn't necessarily a valid system trace,
-- just the first transition is so constrained. 


// (2) Non-starvation 
// If a process indicates interest by flag=true, it will eventually get access. 

// Initial try: it turns out this isn't *quite* right, though.
// (It passes; what could be /wrong/?)

            // (World.loc[p] = Waiting) implies
            // What if:
            (p in World.flags) implies
            // some later state where p gets access
                (eventually World.loc[p] = InCS)
        }}}

  assert {init and always delta} is sufficient for non_starvation
